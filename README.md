# Who am I?

I am an Oracle Database Product Manager for scripting and C language APIs.  This means I am your contact for questions about
<https://github.com/oracle/odpi>, <https://github.com/oracle/python-oracledb>, <https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb>, and for other scripting languages. My group also looks after Oracle Instant Client, SQL\*Plus, and Oracle Network Services (aka SQL*Net).

I also liaise with the excellent community owners and maintainers of other scripting APIs for Oracle Database.
