# Who am I?

I am a "product manager" for some language APIs in the Data Access group of Oracle Database.  This means I am your contact for questions about
<https://github.com/oracle/odpi>, <https://github.com/oracle/python-cx_Oracle>, <https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb>, and for other scripting languages.  I also have responsibility for the packaging of Instant Client.

I also liaise with the excellent community owners and maintainers of other scripting APIs for Oracle Database.

I tweet at <https://twitter.com/ghrd> and blog at <https://blogs.oracle.com/opal>.
