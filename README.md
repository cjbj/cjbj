# Who am I?

I am an Oracle Database Product Manager for scripting and C language APIs.  This means I am your contact for questions about
<https://github.com/oracle/odpi>, <https://github.com/oracle/python-cx_Oracle>, <https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb>, and for other scripting languages.  I also have responsibility for the packaging of Instant Client.

I also liaise with the excellent community owners and maintainers of other scripting APIs for Oracle Database.
